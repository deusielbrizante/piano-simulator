# Piano Simulator

## Game developed alongside DIO's challenge "Potência Tech iFood - Game Development"

The project was developed together with the teacher. I was able to learn how to create pages in HTML, style the page in CSS and create features in JavaScript.

## How to play

<br>
Go to the green button called “Code”, click on it and then on “Download ZIP”. After downloading the file, unzip it with WinRar, 7Zip or an unzipper of your choice, open the folder and double-click on index.html, after that, the game should start. Have a good game.
